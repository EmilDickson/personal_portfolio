                    So who am I? I am 33 years old, I live in Nacka just outside Stockholm.
                </p>
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a Media Technology student at The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm (KTH),
                    currently in my fourth of five years of studies. The programme is interdisciplinary, combining the latest
                    technology with design for various different media. We focus on how human communications is supported by
                    technology and other than learning about programming, math and physics we also take courses about games,
                    visualization, interaction and social aspects of media. For my own masters degree, I have chosen the track
                    Visual Media, in which there is focus on information visualization and interaction.
                </p>
                <h3>Professionally</h3>
                <p>
                    Before starting my education at KTH, I worked for many years as an IT support technician and/or consultant.
                    I began my career in this particular profession two years after graduating high school, in 2007, when I took
                    a position at the internal IT department at Ernst & Young. During 2.5 years working there I provided first
                    line support for over 1000 users all over Sweden, and to some extent in other countries as well. In 2010 I
                    left Ernst & Young and instead joined Excanto as an IT consultant, which I felt was an interesting challenge
                    and a next step for me. Most of my assignments had me visiting customers out on location, which ensured close
                    contact with end users. I feel that this is something I take with me when learning about and implementing
                    user centered design, for instance. I've since had some extra jobs during my time at KTH. This past summer 
                    I was an intern at <a href="https://www.prototyp.se/" target="_blank"><strong>Prototyp</strong></a>, working with 
                    web development for them. It was a very good opportunity for me as I was able to be part of an actual team and 
                    work for a real client.
                </p>
                <h3>Spare time</h3>
                <p>
                    On my free time, when I'm not spending time with my fianc√©e, our two cats or with friends, I work as a
                    graphics operator at <a href="http://www.statnet.se/" target="_blank"><strong>Statnet</strong></a>. Specifically, 
                    I control graphics for live hockey and soccer games in the top Swedish leagues. The job has taught me to work 
                    under stress and to be thorough in my preparations, since just about anything can happen during a live TV broadcast. 
                    Additionally, I am able to combine my love of sports with my interest in statistics and information visualization.

                <h3>Music</h3>
                <p>
                    Music is another passion of mine, and has been since I was very young. In order to have an outlet for this,
                    I sing, play guitar and write songs in the band Snake City Rockers along with three close friends. I started
                    singing in choirs regularly when I was around 9 years old, and kept doing that util I was about 15. That's
                    when I taught myself how to play the guitar and started a band instead. I have also been able to incorporate
                    my interest in recording technologies as a musician, recording EP:s, singles and albums for my various musical
                    projects. My most notable projects are <a href="http://www.snakecityrockers.com" target="_blank">
                    <strong>Snake City Rockers</strong></a>, my <a href="http://www.emildickson.se" target="_blank"><strong>
                    solo project</strong></a> or my old band, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0zWx5DkmH0" target="_blank">
                    <strong>Sound of Trains & Aeroplanes</strong></a>.
