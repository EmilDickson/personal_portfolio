                    This is my master's thesis project. More information to come as work progresses!
                </p>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    The work in this project was done in collaboration with the Swedish Olympic Academy (SOA) and the Swedish
                    Olympic Committe (SOC). They had an active research project about tracking data for kayaking athletes, but
                    wanted a way of visualizing it, to enhance the training process, and ultimately achieving higher athletic
                    success.
                </p>
                <h3>Development Process</h3>
                <p>
                    I've had to do just about everything myself in this project, from testing to design and implementation. It's been
                    a challenge, but also a good learning experience for me personally.
                </p>
                <h4>Initial work & background</h4>
                <p>
                    This phase focused mostly on literature study, but I also held a focus group with representatives from the
                    SOA & SOC. It helped build the foundation for the remainder of the work in the project.

                <img src="sampleSketchimage.png" alt="sample Sketch image" />
                <p>
                    <i>A sample paper sketch and it's corresponding digital version</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I developed a number of design hypotheses from the information I gathered in the previous phase. I began by simply
                    sketching on paper, and then went on to refine theses ideas using the design software <strong>Sketch</strong>.
                    This resulted in a low-fi prototype that I could bring back to the SOA & SOC for evaluation, providing feedback
                    for the implementation stage of the project.
                </p>
                <h4>Implementation</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the stage I am currently in! I am using <strong>React.js</strong> with <strong>Redux</strong> to realize my
                    ideas, and I am using <strong>Firebase</strong> for user management, data management and hosting. Will update this
                    with page as work goes on!
