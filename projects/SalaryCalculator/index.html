                    I wanted to build a tool that would calculate my salary from working at the job I had alongside my studies
                    at this point. I had recently taken a few courses programming in Python at KTH, so this was a natural starting
                    point for me. I simply took a table of tax deductions from the Swedish tax authority and put it into a csv
                    file, creating a lower and higher span of gross salary for each deduction amount in the table. Then I could
                    simply create an algorithm for this and implement it using Python. The result was a script that I could run
                    at the command line, input the hours I had worked and get an estimate of what I would get that month.
                </p>
