                    FootPrint is an ongoing project that I am a part of at KTH. At first, this project was created as part of
                    the course Media Lab (DM2582). Upon completion of this course however, we still felt that there was still
                    work to be done, and further development of FootPrint was chosen as the topic of another project course,
                    Individual Course in Media Technology (DM2904).

                    The actual project itself is a travel planning web app for public transportation that calculates the carbon
                    emission data for any particular travelling route. A comparison to the emissions from travelling the same
                    distance with a car is also included. The point of this is to make travellers aware of the environmental
                    impacts of choices made while trying to get from point A to point B. This will be evaluated during This
                    ongoing project.

                    Rather than making a native app, we decided to focus our efforts on a web app, accessible from any device.
                    We built the app using React, and for its further development, we decided to add Firebase authentication
                    along with Firestore for storing user data. It is deployed using Heroku.

                <p>
                    I have worked a lot with the planning and administrative parts of this project, as well as doing quite a
                    lot of front-end work. The first phase of the project (during DM2582) was very well recieved. We were even
                    able to garner some interest from SLL, who runs public transportation in Stockholm.
