                    PodTalk was a project in the course Media Technology and Interaction Design. We were trying to make podcasts
                    more interactive by adding a comment section to a podcast app. The prototype for the app was built using
                    React Native. Above is a short video demonstrating our prototype.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In this project, I worked mostly on administrative things around the app, which meant making presentations
                    and making sure the project stayed on track, among other things. To go along with the course, we were trying
                    to apply various theoretical aspects of Interaction Design and Human-Computer Interaction, such as the Double
                    Diamond process, Personas/Scenarios, WWWWWH and Co-Discover. So for me it was a learning experience when it
                    comes to UX more than anything else.
