                    Under Isen was a project in a course in XML For Publishing at KTH. Myself and my partner wanted to create a
                    statistics site for the Swedish Hockey League while learning to connect web pages with databases. Since
                    we did not have access to any real data, I wrote a Python script that created fake game scores and imported
                    the line-ups of each team. All of this was then put into an SQL-database and we did the subsequent code with
                    PHP, HTML, CSS and XSLT/XML. In the end, users could manipulate team rosters, add new scores and anything else
                    you'd expect from a simple hockey stats page.

                    Above you can see a screencast of me giving a walkthrough of the project (in Swedish). The database was "on loan" from
                    KTH, so unfortunately that data is gone and the website doesn't work anymore.
