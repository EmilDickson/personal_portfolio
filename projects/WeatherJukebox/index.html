                    Weather Jukebox was a project for a course at KTH called Interaction Programming and the Dynamic Web. This
                    was my first real project trying to work with React and also really trying to use GitHub. The app itself is
                    designed to either retrieve a users' location automatically, or have them input it themselves and then play
                    music based on the current weather at that location. To achieve this, we used APIs from Google and Deezer
                    and I then built a number of simple JavaScript functions that handled selecting music genres based on weather.

                    My contributions to this project was mainly to implement support for Firebase, in order for the interactivity
                    to work as intended. This also entailed user authentication and storing user data, so that the application
                    state would be preserved between sessions and even different devices. I also wrote the logic for the
                    genre-deciding application logic in JavaScript.
