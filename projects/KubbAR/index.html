                    KubbAR was actually a research project in a course at KTH called Multimodal Interactions and Interfaces.
                    My group's aim was to examine how different sounds would affect the experience of an AR game.
                    To achieve this, we made an AR version of the popular outdoor game Kubb. Playing Kubb typically involves
                    throwing wooden sticks around, and is therefore not ideal to play indoors. Due to the weather in
                    Sweden being mostly fairly cold, Swedes could play more Kubb if it could be taken indoors. We set out to
                    tackle this issue by creating the game in Unity, using the ARCore library. The final game was developed
                    as an Android app and we conducted user tests with 16 participants, who played the game with different
                    sound schemes.

                    My contributions to this particular project was mostly finding and modifying sounds to fit to our desired
                    schemes. I also pitched in with programming, and had administrative and/or project management responsibilites.
                    Below is a video walkthrough of the app.
