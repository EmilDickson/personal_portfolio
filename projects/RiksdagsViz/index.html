                RiksdagsViz was a project that I did along with 5 others during a course in Information Visualization
                (DH2321). This is one of the most fun projects I've worked with during my time at KTH, and is something
                that I'm very proud of. It was build using React with Redux and is deployed on Heroku.

                The site visualizes data from the Swedish parliament, in an effort to make this data comprehensible to
                voters. The Swedish parliament makes all of its voting data openly available via their own API. We felt
                that the political landscape in Sweden was becoming more and more polarized, and that the voters were
                lacking
                insight into what actually goes on; what the politicians are doing all day. Therefore, we set out to
                create
                a tool that would make things a little clearer. In RiksdagsViz, users can find information on any
                politician
                or party in the Swedish parliament. There is also information about how parties vote in relation to each
                other,
                news about individual party members, and much more.

                My contribution to this project was mostly front-end development. I worked especially with the circular
                <a href="https://riksdagsviz.herokuapp.com/partier" target="_blank">party comparison tool</a>, together with 
                <a href="https://jonatanlindstroom.github.io/Portfolio/#/" target="_blank">Jonatan Lindström</a>. Apart from this, I was 
                also responsible for presenting the site, whether that meant
                demoing it to the rest of the people taking that course, or displaying it at the
                <a href="http://www.cawards.se/" target="_blank">C-awards</a>.

                Yes, the project was nominated in two categories at the 2019 C-awards. The two categories were "Best
                Business Opportunity" and "Most Creative Technical Application". We didn't end up winning, but we feel
                very honored to have been nominated. Apart from getting a fun road trip together as a group, we got to
                showcase our idea together with other nominees. We were able to discuss our work with industry
                professionals, as well as see the other fascinating projects that were on display. Personally, I also
                got to make an impromptu 1 minute pitch of the project in front of the guests, which was scary and
                exhilarating at the same time, and something I learned a lot from.
