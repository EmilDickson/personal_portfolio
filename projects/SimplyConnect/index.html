                    Simply Connect was a project in a course in Human-Computer Interaction at KTH. We were tasked with defining
                    a group of people who were socially excluded and design something that would remedy this in some way. We
                    decided to design an app that would collect data from social media (Facebook, Instagram) and present it in
                    a way that would be understandable for elderly people, who might not be very tech savy. This course focused
                    more on applying theory from the field of HCI research rather than building a technically complex implementation.

                    We developed a prototype using Proto.io and did as much user testing as possible. I conducted interviews,
                    think-aloud evaluations and observations among many other things. We attempted to utilize as much theory
                    as possible to aid the design work. In the end, the project was successful and we recieved an A for
                    our efforts.
